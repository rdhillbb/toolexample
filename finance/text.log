Text: Revenues, Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), and number of employees

As of March 31, 2023, the number of employees includes almost all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce. We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.

Segment Operating Results

Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below.

As announced on April 20, 2023, we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting.

Hedging gains (losses) related to revenue included in unallocated corporate costs were $278 million and $84 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion.

Additional information relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (unaudited)

Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space

In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.

These severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):

Text: Alphabet Announces First Quarter 2023 Results
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – April 25, 2023 – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial 
results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first 
quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored 
in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see 
huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”
Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 
consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed 
to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering 
our cost base.”
Q1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited)
Our first quarter 2023 results reflect:
i. $2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space; 
ii. a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and 
certain network equipment; and
iii. a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of 
the year. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the 
full fiscal year 2023.
For further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.

PART I ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.
We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.
We generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads,

Segment Operating Results

As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services.

In addition to the Alphabet-level costs included in unallocated corporate costs, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue were $638 million and $(1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Additional Information Relating to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 (unaudited)

Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space

In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million and $649 million, respectively. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.

For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in our segment results.

Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment

In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023, and the effect was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Text: Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties ("Google Network properties"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.
• Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.
• Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.
We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.
We continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube subscriptions, such as:
• Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.
