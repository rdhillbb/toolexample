In his final months, he cast a deciding vote to keep a national health-care program, feuded with the sitting president of his own party and spoke up for the ideals of statesmanship and bipartisanship.

In 1982, former U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes stepped down after 30 years. McCain won the seat. Four years later, when Barry Goldwater retired from the U.S. Senate after five terms, McCain succeeded him. But McCain had his eye on a higher office.He made two unsuccessful bids for the White House, in 2000 and 2008, when he was the GOP nominee. Yet he loved the Senate, where he ultimately left his mark. He served as chairman of Senate Armed Services Committee. He would turn up unexpectedly in war zones. His work ethic earned him the nickname "White Tornado."

The father to seven was protective of his family's privacy, telling the New York Times in the run-up to his 2008 presidential run, "I just feel it’s inappropriate for us to mention our children ... I’d like them to have their own lives.” McCain married Carol Shepp in 1965 and adopted her two sons from a previous marriage, Douglas and Andrew, and they had a daughter, Sidney.After that marriage ended, McCain married Cindy Hensley.
